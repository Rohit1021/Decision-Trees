# Decision-Trees

The overall goal in this project is to build a classification model (under Supervised learning) that predicts
whether a patient will experience in-hospital mortality using various features from the MIMIC dataset, such
as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RESP), oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure (Systolic), blood pressure
(diastolic), and pulse rate (PULSE). You are given with data of two patients in the attached assignment
document (MIMIC dataset). The target variable (class) is a binary variable (Anomaly) defining in-hospital
mortality. That is ‘1’ indicates that the patient died during the hospital stay, and ‘0’ indicates that the patient
was discharged alive from the hospital.
